checkout master branch
from git bash, run '/artoolkitx-master/Source/build.sh windows'
if you also want to use debug mode, then you need to also run 'build.sh windows --debug'
use CMake GUI to create the VS17 project files, runs without errors, only warning is that it can't find OpenGL ES -> note that this project only works with x64! So make sure you select the correct template in CMake GUI on startup
open project in VS17 and compile
copy the DLLs from \artoolkitx-master\SDK\bin to your debug and release folders
copy hiro.patt and kanji.patt from "artoolkitx-master\Examples\Square tracking example with OSG\Android\ARSquareTracking\ARSquareTrackingExample\src\main\assets\Data" to your debug and release folders
run the example
Probably will work with other versions of VS too, but haven't tested it. CMake GUI version I used was 3.11.0.
